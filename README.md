# High School Outreach for GIScience
This repository contains some lessons in GIS that I wrote as part of a community outreach program to get more GIS in high school. 
The lessons can be completed independently by going through the lessonplan pdf. The outreach program did not require a write-up, I have written this hoping that it 
will be useful for others.

The lessons cover an introduction to GIS, basic vector analysis and basic raster analysis. I wrote it for ArcMap, but everything will work in ArcGIS Pro. If you have
any queries or comments please reach out to me!

Here is an example of a map produced from these lessons. Students will carry out a multi-criteria evaluation using basic normalization techniques and raster data analysis to determine flood risk on Rakiura/Stewart Island:
